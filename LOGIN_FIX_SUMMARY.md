# Login and Authentication Fix

## Problem
After removing Google Authentication, the standard email/password login functionality stopped working properly.

## Root Causes
1. The user model still had Google-specific fields and the password field was marked as optional.
2. Components still referenced removed Google sign-in button components.
3. CORS issues with credential handling in the fetchWithCORS utility.
4. Improper error handling in login/register flows.

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Updated User Model
- Made password field required for all users
- Removed Google-specific fields (googleId and profilePicture)

### 2. Fixed UI Components
- Removed all references to Google sign-in buttons from Login and Register components
- Removed "Or" dividers that were meant for Google authentication

### 3. Improved Authentication Request Handling
- Modified fetchWithCORS to handle auth endpoints differently by:
  - Setting credentials to 'omit' for auth endpoints to avoid CORS issues
  - Improved error handling to properly capture and display API error messages

### 4. Enhanced Login and Register Components
- Added more detailed error handling
- Added console logging for debugging
- Used direct fetch calls for authentication to ensure proper handling
- Improved feedback to users during login/registration

### 5. API URL Configuration
- Updated config.js to better handle development vs production environments
- Added logging to help identify which API URL is being used

## Testing
- Created test scripts to verify:
  - User registration is working
  - Login authentication is working
  - Token is properly generated and stored

## Future Considerations
- Consider adding password reset functionality
- Improve validation feedback on forms
- Add multi-factor authentication options
