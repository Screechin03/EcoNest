# Fixing 404 Errors on Route Reloads in EcoNest

## Problem Description

Single Page Applications (SPAs) like EcoNest can experience 404 "Not Found" errors when:
1. Directly accessing a route URL (like `/my-bookings`) by typing it in the address bar
2. Refreshing the page on a route other than the root route
3. Double-loading or multiple refreshes on certain routes

This happens because:
- The server looks for physical files at these paths (e.g., `my-bookings.html`)
- Since SPAs use client-side routing, these files don't exist on the server
- The server returns a 404 error instead of serving the index.html which would load the React app

## Implemented Solution for Render Deployment

Our solution involves multiple layers to address this issue:

### 1. Server-Side Configuration

- **Render YAML Configuration**: Updated with proper rewrites and headers
  ```yaml
  routes:
    - type: rewrite
      source: /.*
      destination: /index.html
  ```

- **static.json for Render**: Created a static.json file with explicit route configuration
  ```json
  {
    "routes": {
      "/**": "index.html"
    }
  }
  ```

### 2. Client-Side Navigation Handling

- **Enhanced Navigation Handler**: Created a utility to track and fix navigation issues
  - Tracks problematic double-navigation events
  - Stores last visited URL in sessionStorage
  - Restores correct URL after page reloads
  - Validates routes and redirects invalid ones

- **React Router Configuration**: Added a catch-all route for 404 handling
  ```jsx
  <Route path="*" element={<NotFoundPage />} />
  ```

### 3. Build Process Improvements

- **Special Render Build Script**: Created a specialized build for Render deployment
  - Generates multiple SPA routing configuration files
  - Adds a 404.html with redirect script
  - Includes runtime validation for route handling

## Using the Deployment Script

1. Run the specialized deployment script:
   ```bash
   ./deploy-render.sh
   ```

2. This script will:
   - Build an optimized frontend bundle for Render
   - Commit and push changes to Git
   - Guide you through deploying both backend and frontend services

## Testing the Solution

After deployment, test your application by:

1. Navigating between pages using the app interface
2. Refreshing the page on non-root routes (e.g., `/my-bookings`, `/cities`)
3. Entering URLs directly in the browser address bar
4. Opening the console to check for navigation events and errors

## Advanced Troubleshooting

If you still experience intermittent 404 errors:

1. Open browser developer tools and monitor the Network tab
2. Check the console for navigation tracking messages
3. Try accessing the route with "#" before the path:
   - Example: `https://econest-frontend.onrender.com/#/my-bookings`
4. Contact Render support if issues persist, mentioning:
   - SPA routing configuration issues
   - Need for 404 redirects to index.html

## Render-Specific Environment Variables

Consider adding these environment variables to your Render service:
- `RENDER_ROUTING_REWRITE=true`: Forces Render to use proper SPA routing
- `NODE_ENV=production`: Ensures production optimizations are active
