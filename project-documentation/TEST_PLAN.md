3. **Expected Result**: The success animation should display the combined total amount of all bookings
4. **Verification**: Check that the amount shown is the sum of all individual booking prices

## 4. Location Information Alignment Testing

### Test Scenario 4.1: Location Text Display

2. **Expected Result**: All existing functionality should continue to work as expected
3. **Verification**: Confirm that the changes have not affected any existing features

### Test Scenario 6.2: Payment Processing Flow
1. Complete a full payment process end-to-end

3. **Verification**: Confirm that bookings are properly recorded in the database with correct status

## Test Execution Notes

- Test on multiple browsers: Chrome, Firefox, Safari
- Test on multiple devices: Desktop, tablet, mobile
- For email testing, use test accounts to avoid spam issues
- Document any unexpected behavior with screenshots
- Verify all animations perform well even on lower-end devices
