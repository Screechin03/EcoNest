# Deployment Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Frontend Build Error
Fixed an error in `frontend/src/config.js` that was causing the build to fail with:
```
Cannot reassign a variable declared with `const`
import.meta.env = import.meta.env || {};
```

#### Solution:
Modified the code to avoid reassigning `import.meta.env` and instead safely check if it exists:
```javascript
// Check if running in development based on environment
// We can't modify import.meta.env, but we can read from it
if (typeof import.meta !== 'undefined' && import.meta.env && import.meta.env.DEV) {
  apiUrl = 'http://localhost:8000/api';
  // ...
}
```

### 2. Environment Variable Checks
Updated `backend/verify-env.js` to remove Google OAuth references since that functionality has been completely removed from the application.

#### Changes:
- Removed checks for `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` and `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`
- Removed code that displayed partial secrets for verification
- Kept all other environment checks intact (MongoDB, JWT, Session)

## Deployment Instructions

1. **Commit and push these changes**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix build error and update environment check script"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Redeploy on Render**:
   - The application should now build successfully without errors
   - Both frontend and backend should deploy correctly

3. **Verify Environment Variables**:
   - Ensure the following environment variables are set in the Render dashboard:
     - `MONGODB_URI`
     - `JWT_SECRET`
     - `SESSION_SECRET`
     - `NODE_ENV` (set to `production`)

4. **Test Login Functionality**:
   - Use the test credentials from `LOGIN_FIX_SUMMARY.md` to verify login works
   - Ensure other application features work as expected

## Note on API URLs
The application continues to use `https://econest-70qt.onrender.com/api` as the API endpoint in production. If the backend URL changes, update this in `frontend/src/config.js`.
