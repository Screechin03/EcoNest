// Production API URL
export const API_URL = 'https://econest-70qt.onrender.com/api';

// For local development, uncomment this line and comment out the line above
// export const API_URL = 'http://localhost:8000/api';

// Note: The API URL still uses the old econest domain while the frontend has been rebranded to Boulevard.
// This is a temporary solution until the backend service is migrated to boulevard-api.onrender.com
