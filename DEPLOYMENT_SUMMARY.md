## Local Development After Deployment

When switching between local development and production:

1. Toggle the API_URL configuration in `frontend/src/config.js`:
   ```js
   // For production:
   export const API_URL = 'https://econest-api.onrender.com/api';
   // export const API_URL = 'http://localhost:8000/api';

   // For local development:
   // export const API_URL = 'https://econest-api.onrender.com/api';
   export const API_URL = 'http://localhost:8000/api';
   ```

2. Run local servers when needed:
   - Backend: `cd backend && npm start`
   - Frontend: `cd frontend && npm run dev`

The application is now fully prepared for deployment on Render.com!
